## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js

This was built using node.js on the backend. To start, everything was built on the front end to get the generator up and running. Next, the function moved to the server.js so that a name could be requested and returned. To randomize the names, I used two arrays for the first and last name. Each survey question anwer had a value of 1-3. The value of the first two answers and the last three answers were used to get the index of the arrays.

## Lessons Learned:

I got more comfortable with using node.js on the backend as I worked through this project and learned to read errors on the terminal. I also learned to use scripts to update the server without constantly restarting using scripts and nodemon.
